# slots-python

This project is a practice space for me to create a slot machine using python code. The algorithm used here will later be used as part of a react slot machine application. 

I will also be building a bot that will be able to interact with the slot machine to generate data and also possibly graph a monte carlo simulation of the slot machine.
